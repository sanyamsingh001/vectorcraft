//! VectorCraft PDF export and import.
//!
//! - [`export`] writes one PDF page per artboard with `krilla`: vector paths (fills, strokes with
//!   caps/joins/miter/dashes, inside/outside alignment as clips, non-zero/even-odd; arrowheads,
//!   width profiles, fitted or dotted dashes as the canvas's filled outlines and brushed strokes
//!   as their brush art), opacity and blend modes (transparency groups),
//!   clip groups, linear/radial gradients (shadings), pattern fills and strokes as their tiles and
//!   freeform gradients as images (clipped to what they paint), embedded images (resampled and
//!   compressed as the Compression settings say) and text as outlined glyph paths, or as real
//!   text in embedded subset fonts (Advanced). Colours are converted, tagged with ICC profiles and
//!   given an output intent as the Output settings say. Hidden objects,
//!   guides and template layers are skipped, and so are non-printing layers unless asked for.
//!   Layers and sublayers can be PDF layers (optional content groups with their visibility, print
//!   state and lock), and overprinting fills and strokes overprint (Advanced).
//!   Each page is its artboard (the trim box) grown by the bleed (the bleed box) and by the
//!   printer's marks around it (the media box), drawn in Registration. [`PdfSettings`] is the Save PDF
//!   dialog's model (standard, compatibility, General, Compression, Marks and Bleeds, Output,
//!   Advanced, Security); options the writer doesn't apply yet come back as warnings. With Preserve
//!   Editing the native document rides along as an embedded file ([`editing()`]). Each page can
//!   carry a thumbnail ([`Thumbnail`], drawn by the caller), and Fast Web View writes a linearised
//!   file (still linearised when encrypted). A PDF 1.3 file ([`PdfSettings::pdf13`]) must be flat:
//!   the app flattens the document first, and the writer refuses transparency that is left.
//! - [`import`] reads PDF (and PDF-compatible `.ai`) pages with `hayro-interpret` into a
//!   [`Document`]: one artboard per page, and a layer per page or per optional content group
//!   (with its visibility, print state and lock; art that is off comes in as a hidden layer),
//!   paths with fill/stroke, clip groups, transparency groups (with isolation and knockout), soft
//!   masks → opacity masks, axial/radial shadings → gradients (stop opacity and unextended ends
//!   kept), mesh shadings → gradient meshes, tiling patterns → pattern swatches, images (JPEG
//!   passthrough, others re-encoded as PNG) and text as point type (or glyph outlines, see
//!   [`TextAs`]). Colours keep their model: CMYK, Gray, and spot
//!   inks (Separation, DeviceN) as spot swatches at a tint; a file painted mostly in CMYK opens as a
//!   CMYK document. [`ImportOptions`] pick the pages, the box each
//!   artboard gets ([`CropTo`]) and the password; [`info`] lists the pages and their boxes.
//!   The native document a PDF carries comes back too ([`ImportReport::native`], [`editing()`]).
//! - Presets: named settings, the built-in ones generated in code ([`builtin_presets`]).
//! - [`print()`] lays a document out on paper as File → Print does ([`PrintSettings`]) and writes
//!   the job as a print-ready PDF: composite or one page per ink.
//! - Security: the open and permissions passwords encrypt the written file with the standard
//!   security handler, the algorithm following the compatibility ([`Encryption`]); either password
//!   opens an encrypted file.
